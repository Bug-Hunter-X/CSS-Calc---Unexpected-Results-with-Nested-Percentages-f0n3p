The CSS property `calc()` might lead to unexpected results if you try to use it with percentages that are dependent on other percentage values.  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10%);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% - 10% of parent);` will not because the parent's percentage is not directly available within the `calc()` function.
